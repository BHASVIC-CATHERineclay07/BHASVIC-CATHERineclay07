o These repositories should then be “tidied up” and the readme’s updated to include details of what the prompt/task was and what you learned from completing this task.

o If you’ve used inappropriate commit names, or your repositories are very disorganised, it might be easier to make a new repository and copy the work across.

· Links to repositories that contain any personal projects you want to showcase.

o Again, make sure that the repositories are organised and professional and consider whether it would be better to create new repositories and copy the work in rather than “fixing” old repositories
